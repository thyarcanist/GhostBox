-----------------------------------------------
Created a spawner that spits out new ghosts every x seconds.
Added a points counter that adds everytime the player catches a ghost.
Created a button the player can press to turn on and off music.
Added the parentTransform, to allow another ghost to spawn.
Refactoried some code but ultimately left some in.



Bugs:
	- An issue with playing the sound the triggers when the player catches a ghost.
	- PRIORITY: Ghosts are spawning in the wrong area. (big and at the bottom left) FIXED: REASON BELOW
	- PRIORITY: Clicking anywhere will capture the ghost.   FIXED: REASON BELOW
	- Audio button was missing and wouldn't show up in the screen FIXED: There was a second canvas in the Scene Hierarchy
	- Ghosts won't delete after SetActive due to Coroutine not running because its inactive


TODO:
	- Implement touch-based control.
	- Close the box when a ghost is captured.
	- Open the box when a ghost is on screen.
	- Randomize which ghost appears from the screen,
	{ghostTypes0 - 4}
	- Create a QUIT Button
	- Choose a random GhostHealth enum to go with the type (or have it preselected from randomized ghost)
	- Earn a score, from +1, +3 and +5 from how fast a ghost is clicked on:
			+1 - Clicked on in over 8 seconds
			+3 - Clicked on in less than 5 but over 3 seconds
			+5 - Clicked on in less than 3 seconds
	- Add a cherry and chocolate drawn object, those give +10 points and are every "X" seconds to spawn.
	- Add my own songs to play this too.
	- Orient gamescreen based on window size

Player can earn a score for touching a ghost from: 1, 3 and 5.
GhostCaptureCount in GameManager will not run unless it's in an activate GameScene (There is only a level 1)
Fixed issue with ghosts spawning the wrong area, had reference set as a GameObject rather than a Transform. However, it's not spawning in the right size.
Fixed issue where clicking anywhere -- I had a method still in update & just made the object a button.
